# Employee Database with SQL

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assist company Pewlett Hackard on the analysis of employee's retiring using
SQL. The dataset is only available in the form of six CSV files because Excel and VBA have been mostly used to work 
with this data. The task is to build an employee database with SQL and help prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many 
current employees reach retirement age.

### Results

- The positions like Senior Engineer and Senior Staff has the highest number of employees retiring. This is shown in the retiring_titles table.

- The employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program are born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. The total number eligible is 1549 employees.

## Summary 

There are 72,459 positions needed to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
I don't beleive there are enough eligible employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
